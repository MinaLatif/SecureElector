# NutriSon

''''''NOTE''''''
The project code was largely based off of https://github.com/stahlmanDesign/node-express-multer-image-upload for the image upload. 

What is your project? 

Our project informs users of nutrient facts about different types of food taken with respective images uploaded.

What challenge does it solve? 

Helps users make wise food choices. 
Allows users to identify new foods, if they are new to the location and their nutrients.
Provides useful nutritional information to ensure balanced meals. 

Why is it important?

Helps user to stay healthy/fit and maintain their daily calorie intake

Who does it serve?

It serves all users who want to know more about their food and develop better food choices 

What data sets did you use?

No datasets were used as IBM Watson already included a trained classifier able of classifying a variety of different foods.

How feasible is this to implement for Watson Health? 

This project is quite feasible as it is very easy to implement with current existing open source APIs and the powerful Machine learning capabilities of Watson Classifiers.

How useful is this innovation for Watson Health? 

This innovation is quite useful for many Watson Health users as it allows users to learn about new foods and make wise food choices depending on specific nutrient facts.


What did you learn through working on this project?

Watson Classifiers using Visual Recognition REST APIs used to recognize food pictures uploaded, NutritionIX API used to query for nutrient information regarding food identified by Watson
